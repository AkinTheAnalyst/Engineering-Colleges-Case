# Engineering-Colleges-Case

# Context
Education is fast becoming a very competitive sector with hundreds of institutions to choose from. It is a life-transforming experience for any student and it has to be a thoughtful decision. There are ranking agencies that do a survey of all the colleges to provide more insights to students. Agency RankForYou wants to leverage this year's survey to roll out an editorial article in leading newspapers, on the state of engineering education in the country. Head of PR (Public Relations) comes to you, the data scientist working at RankForYou, and asks you to come up with evidence-based insights for that article.

# Objective
To identify different types of engineering colleges in the country to better understand the state of affairs.
